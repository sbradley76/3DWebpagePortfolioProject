        <p>I enjoy 3D Modeling as a hobby, and with the help of HTML and JS, create an Interactable 3D Webpage <br>
        Showcasing some of my 3D Art.</p>

        <h2>How I made this Webpage</h2>
        <p>This webpage was programmed using JavaScript utilizing the THREE.js Libraries. These resources <br>
        provide many useful tools for 3D rendering, such as Cameras, Lights, and Different types of Renderers. <br></p>

        <p>I am able to create primative shapes using code, or I may import my own 3D meshes to this website. <br>
        I may texture these objects by importing images to overlay onto each mesh, and built in methods will <br>
        do the texture mapping for me!</p>

        <h2>How This Project Will Aid Me In The Future</h2>
        <p>This webpage utilizes many libraries that are not necessarily common or trivial to use in typical <br>
        front end development. I really try to be creative and unique, hence why I created this interactive webpage.</p>
        <p>These skills will follow me through any front end development, or any 3D project programmed using JavaScript.</p>
